          This was among the earliest web-embedable media players to be released
          to the public domain. Written in ActionScript 3.0 (an ECMA-family
          computer language created by
          <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.adobe.com/" target="_blank"
            >Adobe Inc.</a

          purposes well (for its market) during the "more dismal" age of the
          world wide web, when HTML5 hadn't been born and Adobe Flash still
          reigned the interactive media market). This was fun to write and I'm
          forever proud to have worked on it.

        <p class="ltr">
          My early career was moulded in different business environments
          (startup to medium-sized corporate) spanning several industries:
          Digital Creative & Marketing, Online Entertainment, EdTech,
          Infrastructure & Hosting. I worked a variety of technical roles, both
          as IC and people manager, some including business management, customer
          and shareholder interfacing, and fund raising.
        </p>
        <p class="ltr">
          During these years, I maintained technical foci irregardless of
          employment natures, thanks to which I sharpened client-side &
          server-side software development, as well as Linux server management,
          system scalability, and cloud engineering skillsets.
        </p>
        <p class="ltr">
          Some of the major skills I attained (at industrially productive level)
          during this time were: PHP, ActionScript, CSS, Computer Graphics
          Manipulation &amp; Animation, JavaScript, Node.js, Apache, Nginx,
          Linux Server Management, Geo-aware web-scaled software, On-Premise and
          Cloud-based software deployments.
