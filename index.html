        <p class="ltr">
          Moulded in different business environments,
          startup to medium-sized corporate, spanning the industries:
          Digital Creative &amp; Marketing, Online Entertainment, EdTech,
          Infrastructure &amp; Hosting, I worked a variety of technical roles, both
          as IC and people manager, some including business management, customer
          and shareholder interfacing, and fund raising
        </p>
        <p class="ltr">
          In this period, I sharpened client-side &
          server-side software development knowhows, plus Linux server management,
          system scalability, and cloud engineering backgrounds
        </p>
        <p class="ltr">
          Major skills I attained at industrially productive level: PHP, ActionScript, CSS, Computer Graphics
          Manipulation &amp; Animation, JavaScript, Node.js, Apache, Nginx,
          Linux Server Management, Geo-aware web-scaled software, On-Premise and
          Cloud-based software deployments

          This was among the earliest web-embedable media players to be released

          purposes well for its market during this "dismal" age of the
          WWWW, when HTML5 hadn't been born and Adobe Flash still
          reigned the interactive media market. This was fun to write and I'm
